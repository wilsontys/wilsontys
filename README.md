An experienced manager with a diverse background of over 15 years of experience in leading high performance teams, I am looking to transition into a role whereby my data and business analytics skills can be put to good use. I am no stranger to data and analytical tools like Excel, Power BI, SQL and Python. 

Working with data is exciting and satisfying. I would like to help everyone make informed decisions and to stop guessing! I have also enjoyed generating new ideas and using data insights to devise feasible solutions to broadly relevant problems. There is a sense of accomplishment when I am able to boldly go where no man has gone before. In addition, being a Certified ScrumMaster® (CSM®), I am a keen practitioner in Agile management and Scrum. Originally developed in the software industry, I believe the Agile approach has the potential to transform the way we operate in today's world. 

With over 15 years of experience in leading global teams in Singapore, Malaysia and Indonesia, I have been successful in driving strong annual performances from my previous appointments. Among my accomplishments: an increased in SME sales revenue by 300% and an expansion in the number of accounts by 200% in less than a year. As part of my recent training in the Rapid & Immersive Skill Enhancement (RISE) programme by Boston Consulting Group, I have contributed to 5 Python focused mini-projects, 1 hackathon and 1 capstone project. 

Competencies: business development, revenue management, business analysis, data analysis, sales & marketing management, stakeholders engagement
